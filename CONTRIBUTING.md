# Contribution Guidelines

Wealthfront welcomes contributions ranging from small bug fixes to large features. 

- For larger features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the direction. That way, others can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
- For small feature requests, you can also open an issue for upfront discussion or,  if you prefer, opt instead for a demo implementation in a PR.
- If you've found a bug and would like help with a solution, please contribute a failing test case so we can study and fix it.

We'd like to help review the design and implementation as early as possible so please submit the pull request even if it's not 100% ready. Just let us know the purpose of the change and list the remaining items which need to be addressed before itâ€™s merged. PR's should include unit tests and documentation where appropriate.

If you see any security related issues, please email security@wealthfront.com.

**Note:** Before any code can be accepted all contributors must complete our Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is mandated by our CLA assistant tool when you make your first pull request.

### Dos and Don'ts

- DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- DO follow our coding style
- DON'T submit PRs that alter licensing - related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
